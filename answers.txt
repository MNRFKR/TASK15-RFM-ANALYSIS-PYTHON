What is RFM and where is it used?
RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary — a customer segmentation technique. It is widely used in marketing and CRM to identify customer value and target strategies.
How do you define Recency in RFM?
Recency measures how recently a customer made a purchase. Customers with lower recency values are considered more engaged and valuable.
Why do we use quantile binning in segmentation?
Quantile binning divides customers into equal-sized groups based on their RFM values. This ensures balanced segmentation and fair comparison across different ranges.
What actions can be taken for “At Risk” customers?
At Risk customers can be re‑engaged with win‑back campaigns, personalized offers, and feedback requests. The goal is to rebuild trust and encourage them to return.
How do you validate segmentation usefulness?
Segmentation is validated by checking business outcomes like retention, conversion, and revenue uplift. Comparing segment behavior against KPIs confirms its practical value
